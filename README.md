Open DarkBASIC
==============

This project is currently just an excuse for me to learn more about parsing with Flex/Bison. My goal is to successfully parse my old DarkBASIC projects into an AST and interpret it.

It *may* evolve into actually reimplementing the DarkBASIC SDK on top of OpenGL and/or Vulkan, and it *may* evolve into writing a compiler/assembler. Who knows.
